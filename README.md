This project focuses on developing a predictive maintenance model for IoT devices using the AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset. 
The objective is to forecast potential equipment failures by analyzing sensor data, including air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear. 
The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest. 
The final model aims to provide actionable insights that can help in timely maintenance interventions, reducing unplanned downtime and improving operational efficiency.
